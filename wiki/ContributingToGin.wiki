= Contributing to GIN =

Thanks for your interest in contributing to GIN! In general, the process is similar to [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/makinggwtbetter.html#contributingcode GWT's extremely well-documented process].

== Code style ==

GIN uses the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/makinggwtbetter.html#codestyle same code style rules as GWT], except that lines are allowed to be 100 characters long.

== Submitting a patch ==
This process applies for committers and non-committers alike.

  # Create an issue in the GIN issue tracker, if needed. For simple internal changes, this step can be omitted.
  # Submit a [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/makinggwtbetter.html#clas contributor license agreement], if you have not done so before. (You can do this electronically.)
  # Attach a patch to the issue.
  # Using http://codereview.appspot.com, submit your patch for review to bstoler@google.com, cc: google-gin@googlegroups.com
  # Once the review is complete (ending in an LGTM):
    * If you are a committer, submit.
    * If you are not a committer, ask a committer to submit your updated patch.
  # Close the issue with a reference to the commit.
